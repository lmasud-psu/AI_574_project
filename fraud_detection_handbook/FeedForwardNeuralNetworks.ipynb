[Dataset](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html?highlight=dataset#torch.utils.data.Dataset) is the interface to access the data. Given a sample's index, it provides a well-formed input-output for the model. [Dataloader](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html?highlight=dataloader#torch.utils.data.DataLoader) takes the Dataset as input and provides an iterator for the training loop. It also allows to create batches, shuffle data, and parallelize data preparation. \n",

It has an init function in which it instantiates all the necessary submodules (layers) and initializes their weights. It also has a forward function that defines all the operations of the forward pass. \n",
    "* The optimizer: The [optimizer](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html) is the object that implements the optimization algorithm. It is called after the loss is computed to calculate the necessary model updates. The most basic one is SGD, but there are many others like RMSProp, Adagrad, Adam, ...\n",
    "* Training loop and evaluation: the training loop is the core of a model's training. It consists in performing several iterations (epochs), getting all the training batches from the loader, performing the forward pass, computing the loss, and calling the optimizer. After each epoch, an evaluation can be performed to track the model's evolution and possibly stop the process.\n",

This example is provided for educational purposes. But the concept of Dataset has a high interest when sample preparation requires more preprocessing. For instance, it becomes very handy for sequence preparation when using recurrent models (like an LSTM). This will be covered more in-depth later in this chapter but for example, a Dataset for sequential models performs several operations before returning a sample: searching for the history of transactions of the same cardholder and appending it to the current transaction before returning the whole sequence. It avoids preparing all the sequences in advance, which would entail repeating several transactions' features in memory and consuming more RAM than necessary.

The role of the loss function is precisely to measure the discrepancy between the predicted value and the expected value (0 or 1), also referred to as the ground truth. There are many loss functions (mean squared error, cross-entropy, KL-divergence, hinge loss, mean absolute error) available in PyTorch, and each serves a specific purpose. Here we only focus on binary cross-entropy because it is the most relevant loss function for binary classification problems like fraud detection. It is defined as follows:\n",

This means that the optimization is going well: the chosen learning rate allows to update the model towards a better solution (lower loss) for the **training dataset**. However, neural networks are known to be very expressive models. In fact, the universal approximation theorem shows that, with enough neurons/layers, one can model any function with a neural network {cite}`cybenko1989approximation`. Therefore, it is expected for a complex neural network to be able to fit almost perfectly the training data. But the ultimate goal is to obtain a model that generalizes well on unseen data (like the validation set). Looking at the validation loss, one can see that it starts by decreasing (with oscillations) and it reaches an optimum around 0.019, and stops decreasing (or even starts increasing). This phenomenon is referred to as [overfitting](Model_Selection).\n",
    "\n",
    "Many aspects can be improved in the training. Although one cannot measure the performance on the final test set while training, one can rely on a validation set and try to stop training before overfitting (see [](Model_Selection)). One can also change the optimization algorithm and parameters to speed up training and reach a better optimum. This is investigated later, in the optimization paragraph."

    "Now that a clean optimization process is defined, one can consider several solutions to speed up and improve convergence towards a decent extremum. The most natural way to do so is to play with the optimizer hyperparameters like the learning rate and the batch size. With a large learning rate, gradient descent is fast at the beginning, but then the optimizer struggles to find the minimum. Adaptive learning rate techniques like Adam/RMSProp take into account the steepness by normalizing the learning rate with respect to the gradient norm. Below are the formulas to update on a model parameter $w_t$ with Adam.\n",

Of course, increasing patience or changing the learning rate with SGD would probably help improve both speed and optimum. Nevertheless, Adam will be retained for the rest of the chapter as it usually allows very decent performance **without significant tuning**. To build the final neural network later, the tuning will mostly be made using batch size and initial learning rate. "

But keep in mind that neural network optimization is a very wide and active area of research/engineering. For instance, with Deep Networks, one can apply batch normalization after each layer to standardize the distribution and speed up convergence. One can also reduce the learning rate when validation loss reaches a plateau (`torch.optim.ReduceLROnPlateau`).

    "A classical way to improve generalization and reach a better validation performance is to regularize the model. Roughly speaking, regularization consists in limiting the model expressiveness in order to reduce overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most common technique to regularize a machine learning model is to restrict its parameter space, for instance, its norm, by adding a term in the optimization problem. Additionally, to minimize the discrepancy between ground truth and prediction, integrating an L1 norm (resp. L2 norm) term in the loss will entail parameter sparsity (resp. will limit parameters amplitude). The initial solution space is generally full of equivalent solutions (e.g. with linear activations, dividing all input weights of a neuron by 2 and multiplying all of its output weights by 2 leads to an equivalent model), so the restrictions entailed by regularization not only limits overfitting but also reduces the search and can help with optimization. Finally, selecting a solution with minimal norm follows the principle of \"All things being equal, the simplest solution tends to be the best one\", a scientific principle often referred to as the [Occam's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor).\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to adding loss terms, there is a regularization technique specifically designed for Neural Networks called dropout. Dropout consists in randomly dropping some neurons from the network at each training step. More precisely, one fixes a dropout parameter p∈[0,1], and, for each mini-batch, for each neuron, performs a coin toss (Bernoulli) with probability p. If positive, one temporarily sets the neuron's weights to zero (so that the dropped neuron is not considered during the forward and backward passes). It is equivalent to training a random sub-network at each mini-batch (Figure 5), and it can be proven that this has an L2-regularization effect on specific architectures {cite}`srivastava2014dropout`.\n",

    "It is generally reported that a small dropout value can lead to better generalization results than no dropout, but it can sometimes be the opposite if the training data are very rich, if the training distribution is close to the valid/test distribution, and if the model is already not too expressive. So, the best practice is to consider dropout as a hyperparameter (that could be set to 0) and tune it with a hyperparameter search. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the L2-regularization effect, dropout can be seen as a very powerful mechanism that mimics ensembling strategies like bagging (the model can be seen as an ensemble of submodels trained on different subsets of data) {cite}`goodfellow2016deep`. "

    "XGBoost and random forests learn splits on single features and therefore are robust to the scale and distribution of the values. On the contrary, in a neural network, each neuron of the first layer learns a linear combination of all the features. Therefore, it is easier to train the neurons when all features have the same range and are normally distributed. The first property can be easily implemented by applying min-max or standard scaling on the features. As for the second property, it depends on the original distribution of the features. Some of them are not normally distributed and have non-linear scales (e.g. amount): increasing the amount by 5 dollars should not have the same effect if the starting point is 5 dollars or if the starting point is 100 dollars. It turns out that applying the log function on such features can make their distribution slightly more normal which makes it easier for feed-forward neural networks to learn from them. "

    "Properly taking into account categorical variables is maybe one of the main advantages of neural networks. In the first chapters, [feature transformation techniques](Baseline_Feature_Transformation) were applied to categorical features like day, Customer ID, Terminal ID, in order to make them binary or to extract numerical features from them. \n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world data, categorical features are frequent (Country, Merchant Type, hour, type of payment, ...). But most machine learning algorithms require features to be numerical. Take the example of linear regression: it is basically a weighted sum of the features' values. For numerical features, it makes sense to consider that their impact is proportional to their value (e.g. the smaller the delay between two transactions, the higher the fraud risk), but it does not make sense for a nominal feature like a Country that can take the values \"USA\", \"France\", \"Belgium\". For the latter, a transformation is necessary. The most common choices are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* One-hot encoding: a binary feature is defined for each modality (e.g. \"country_is_USA\", \"country_is_France\" and \"country_is_Belgium\").\n",
    "* Frequency-based encoding: The frequency (or another statistic) of each modality is computed and the index of the modality is replaced with the value of the statistic. \n",
    "* Label-correlation encoding: It is close to frequency encoding but here a statistic correlated with the label is computed. For instance, each modality can be replaced with its proportion of fraud in the training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "With neural networks, one can make use of embedding layers to encode categorical variables. More precisely, the idea is to let the neural network itself learn a representation of each modality of the categorical variable in a continuous vector space of dimension k, chosen by the practitioner. These representations can be learned end-to-end to make the feed-forward network optimal for the fraud detection task. They can also be learned with a different objective like predicting the sequences of countries visited by cardholders (unsupervised pre-training) and then later used for fraud detection, either with a neural network classifier or any other classifier (XGBoost, random forest, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "![Embedding layer illustration](./images/embedding.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that learning an embedding of dimension $k$ for a categorical feature is computationally equivalent to learning a classical fully connected layer that takes as input the one-hot encoding of the feature and outputs $k$ neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test embedding layers, let us try to add extra categorical inputs in $x$ and let the model learn embedding for them. Our last neural network was trained on the following features:"

    "The performance here is not necessarily better with the categorical features (they do not add value compared to the engineered features, at least for the fraud patterns in our categorical data). This implementation is shown for educational purposes. Keep in mind that embedding layers are often a valuable solution in practice when training with a lot of data because it is a step forward in automation (instead of expert feature engineering, one can leave the representation choice to the model). \n",
    "\n",
    "Embedding can also be interesting for interpretability. Indeed, at the end of training, one can extract `model.emb[i].weight`. Each row of this matrix represents the embedding vector of a given modality for the `i-th` categorical feature. This can be used to compute similarities between modalities. One can also reduce these vectors' dimensionality with TSNE or PCA and visualize all modalities on a 2D plane."

    "To go further and improve the results, ensembling is a common strategy with neural networks in general and for fraud detection. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to simply train the architecture several times and average the predictions of all the obtained models at inference {cite}`zhou2021ensemble`. Layer initialization and the random batch order are generally enough to ensure diversity between each submodel and make the ensemble better than each individual. To go further, one can also train each individual on a different train/valid split {cite}`breiman1996bagging`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensembling is also very useful for fraud detection, in particular, because of concept drift. Indeed, in fraud detection, the fraudsters' techniques are varied and change over time. A single model can struggle to both learn and remember all the different patterns for the target class. In this context, it is expected that an ensemble of models, efficiently built, can cope with the issue. The intuition is that the different components of the ensemble can be specialized for different tasks. For example, a component could be specialized for the recent patterns and another for the old patterns {cite}`lebichot2021incremental`. Similarly, a component could be specialized for the easiest and generic fraudsters’ strategies and another for advanced concepts."

We will resort to the library `skorch`, which provides an `sklearn` wrapper for `PyTorch` modules. Also, early stopping won't be used, but instead the number of epochs ([10,20,40]) will be another parameter to search."

First, `sklearn`'s classifiers have two output probabilities (one for each class) that are complementary. Therefore, the output of `fc2` has to be changed to 2, and the activation to `softmax` (similar to the sigmoid activation but with a global normalization). Second, the dataset has to expect arrays instead of tensors, so the conversion will be done within the dataset. "

    "Since the number of parameters to tune is large here, and the training (with 20-40 epochs) is rather slow, the execution of the grid-search can take a long time (7350 seconds here). Indeed, it requires training 162 neural networks for each train/valid split of the prequential validation. To speed up the process, it would be beneficial to adopt the random search as suggested at the end of Section 5.3 or to use a hyperparameter tuning method more adapted to neural networks."

    "First, if we fix the number of epochs to 20, the dropout level to 0.2, the lower batch size leads to better results for average precision and card precision on the test set, whereas there is a sweet spot according to AUC-ROC. In fact, the optimal batch size is strongly connected to other optimizer parameters. Often, a larger batch size requires a larger number of epochs. To verify that, let us visualize the same plots but with the number of epochs to 40."

    "This section gave an overview of how to design a feed-forward neural network for fraud detection. Comparatively to classical machine learning models, neural networks have an infinite set of hyperparameters. This modularity in the design has a lot of advantages in terms of expressivity but it comes at the cost of a time-consuming hyper optimization of the architecture, the activations, the loss, the optimizers, the preprocessing, etc. Nevertheless, there are many ways to automate hyper optimization and architecture design, for instance with AutoML including Neural Architecture Search (or NAS) {cite}`elsken2019neural`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here only the top of the iceberg is covered. There are many other aspects to consider even with such a simple neural network. Many of them can be found in good practice guides and generally also apply to fraud detection. Some are even specific to problems like the latter. An important one is to manage imbalance (refer to Chapter 6 for more details): it can be done with neural networks by replacing binary cross-entropy with a weighted BCE (putting more importance on the loss terms associated with fraud samples) or with focal loss, a variant of cross-entropy specifically designed to automatically focus on under-represented samples. Another way is to implement a custom Dataloader with a [balanced sampler](https://github.com/ufoym/imbalanced-dataset-sampler).\n",

    "The rest of the chapter rather focuses on different types of neural network models like autoencoders or sequential models and the way they can be used in a fraud detection context."
